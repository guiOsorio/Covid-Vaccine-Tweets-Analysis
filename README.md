# Covid-Vaccine-Tweets-Analysis

This project works with data extracted from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/all-covid19-vaccines-tweets). This project was the culmination of the material learned in the class BUAN 370, Descriptive Analytics & Data Management. The goal of the class project was to go through the process of choosing a dataset and transforming it into a TIDY dataset for analysis. Afterwards, an exploratory analysis of the data was conducted, with information being obtained by running SQL-like queries (using the library sqldf), and creating visualizations (using the library ggplot2).

## Technologies used / Skills gained:
- Data analysis in R;
- Data cleaning with dplyr;
- Data visualization with ggplot2;
- Running queries with the library sqldf;
